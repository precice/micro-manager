summary: Provide a JSON file to configure the Micro Manager.

{% note %} In the preCICE XML configuration the Micro Manager is a participant with the name `Micro-Manager`. {% endnote %}

The Micro Manager is configured with a JSON file. An example configuration file is

```json
{
    "micro_file_name": "micro_solver",
    "coupling_params": {
        "config_file_name": "precice-config.xml",
        "macro_mesh_name": "macro-mesh",
        "read_data_names": {"temperature": "scalar", "heat-flux": "vector"},
        "write_data_names": {"porosity": "scalar", "conductivity": "vector"},
        "micro_time_window_size": 1.0
    },
    "simulation_params": {
        "macro_domain_bounds": [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0],
    },
    "diagnostics": {
      "output_micro_sim_solve_time": "True"
    }
}
```

This example configuration file is in [`examples/micro-manager-config.json`](https://github.com/precice/micro-manager/tree/develop/examples/micro-manager-config.json).

The path to the file containing the Python importable micro simulation class is specified in the `micro_file_name` parameter. If the file is not in the working directory, give the relative path.

There are three main sections in the configuration file, the `coupling_params`, the `simulation_params` and the optional `diagnostics`.

## Coupling Parameters

Parameter | Description
--- | ---
`config_file_name` |  Path to the preCICE XML configuration file from the current working directory.
`macro_mesh_name` |  Name of the macro mesh as stated in the preCICE configuration.
`read_data_names` |  A Python dictionary with the names of the data to be read from preCICE as keys and `"scalar"` or `"vector"`  as values depending on the nature of the data.
`write_data_names` |  A Python dictionary with the names of the data to be written to preCICE as keys and `"scalar"` or `"vector"`  as values depending on the nature of the data.
`micro_dt` | Initial time window size (dt) of the micro simulation.

## Simulation Parameters

Parameter | Description
--- | ---
`macro_domain_bounds`| Minimum and maximum bounds of the macro-domain, having the format `[xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax]` in 3D and `[xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax]` in 2D.
Domain decomposition parameters | See section on [domain decomposition](#domain-decomposition). But default, the Micro Manager assumes that it will be run in serial.
Adaptivity parameters | See section on [adaptivity](#adaptivity). By default, adaptivity is disabled.

## Diagnostics

Parameter | Description
--- | ---
`data_from_micro_sims` | A Python dictionary with the names of the data from the micro simulation to be written to VTK files as keys and `"scalar"` or `"vector"` as values.
`output_micro_sim_solve_time` | If `True`, the Micro Manager writes the wall clock time of the `solve()` function of each micro simulation.
`micro_output_n`|  Frequency of calling the optional output functionality of the micro simulation in terms of number of time steps. If not given, `micro_sim.output()` is called every time step.

### Adding diagnostics in the preCICE XML configuration

If the parameter `data_from_micro_sims` is set, the data to be output needs to be written to preCICE, and an export tag needs to be added for the participant `Micro-Manager`. For example, let us consider the case that the data `porosity`, which is a scalar, needs to be exported. Unless already defined, define the data, and then write it to preCICE. Also, add an export tag. The resulting entries in the XML configuration file look like:

```xml
<data:scalar name="porosity"/>

<participant name="Micro-Manager">
  ...
  <write-data name="porosity" mesh="macro-mesh"/>
  <export:vtu directory="Micro-Manager-output" every-n-time-windows="5"/>
</participant>
```

If `output_micro_sim_solve_time` is set, add similar entries for the data `micro_sim_time` in the following way:

```xml
<data:scalar name="micro_sim_time"/>

<participant name="Micro-Manager">
  ...
  <write-data name="micro_sim_time" mesh="macro-mesh"/>
  <export:vtu directory="Micro-Manager-output" every-n-time-windows="5"/>
</participant>
```

## Domain decomposition

The Micro Manager can be run in parallel. For a parallel run, set the desired partitions in each axis by setting the `decomposition` parameter. For example, if the domain is 3D and the decomposition needs to be two partitions in x, one partition in y, and sixteen partitions in for z, the setting is

```json
"simulation_params": {
    "macro_domain_bounds": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    "decomposition": [2, 1, 16]
}
```

For a 2D domain, only two values need to be set for `decomposition`. The total number of partitions provided in the `decomposition` should be the same as the number of processors provided in the `mpirun`/`mpiexec` command.

## Adaptivity

The Micro Manager can adaptively control micro simulations. The adaptivity strategy is taken from

1. Redeker, Magnus & Eck, Christof. (2013). A fast and accurate adaptive solution strategy for two-scale models with continuous inter-scale dependencies. Journal of Computational Physics. 240. 268-283. [10.1016/j.jcp.2012.12.025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2012.12.025).

2. Bastidas, Manuela & Bringedal, Carina & Pop, Iuliu Sorin. (2021). A two-scale iterative scheme for a phase-field model for precipitation and dissolution in porous media. Applied Mathematics and Computation. 396. 125933. [10.1016/j.amc.2020.125933](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amc.2020.125933).

All the adaptivity parameters are chosen from the second publication.

To turn on adaptivity, set `"adaptivity": True` in `simulation_params`. Then under `adaptivity_settings` set the following variables:

Parameter | Description
--- | ---
`type` | Set to either `local` or `global`. The type of adaptivity matters when the Micro Manager is run in parallel. `local` means comparing micro simulations within a local partitioned domain for similarity. `global` means comparing micro simulations from all partitions, so over the entire domain.
`data` | List of names of data which are to be used to calculate if micro-simulations are similar or not. For example `["temperature", "porosity"]`.
`history_param` | History parameter $$ \Lambda $$, set as $$ \Lambda >= 0 $$.
`coarsening_constant` | Coarsening constant $$ C_c $$, set as $$ C_c < 1 $$.
`refining_constant` | Refining constant $$ C_r $$, set as $$ C_r >= 0 $$.
`every_implicit_iteration` | If True, adaptivity is calculated in every implicit iteration. <br> If False, adaptivity is calculated once at the start of the time window and then reused in every implicit time iteration.
`similarity_measure`| Similarity measure to be used for adaptivity. Can be either `L1`, `L2`, `L1rel` or `L2rel`. By default, `L1` is used. The `rel` variants calculate the respective relative norms. This parameter is *optional*.

Example of adaptivity configuration is

```json
"simulation_params": {
    "macro_domain_bounds": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    "adaptivity": "True",
    "adaptivity_settings" {
        "type": "local",
        "data": ["temperature", "porosity"],
        "history_param": 0.5,
        "coarsening_constant": 0.3,
        "refining_constant": 0.4,
        "every_implicit_iteration": "True"
    }
}
```

### Adding adaptivity in the preCICE XML configuration

If adaptivity is used, the Micro Manager will attempt to write two scalar data per micro simulation to preCICE, called `active_state` and `active_steps`.

Parameter | Description
--- | ---
`active_state` | `1` if the micro simulation is active in the time window, and `0` if inactive.
`active_steps` | Summation of `active_state` up to the current time window.

The Micro Manager uses the output functionality of preCICE, hence these data sets need to be manually added to the preCICE configuration file. In the mesh and the participant Micro-Manager add the following lines:

```xml
<data:scalar name="active_state"/>
<data:scalar name="active_steps"/>

<mesh name="macro-mesh">
    <use-data name="active_state"/>
    <use-data name="active_steps"/>
</mesh>

<participant name="Micro-Manager">
    <write-data name="active_state" mesh="macro-mesh"/>
    <write-data name="active_steps" mesh="macro-mesh"/>
</participant>
```

## Interpolate a crashed micro simulation

If the optional dependency `sklearn' is installed, the Micro Manager will derive the output of a crashed micro simulation by interpolating outputs from similar simulations. To enable this, set
`"interpolate_crash": "True"` in the `simulation_params` section of the configuration file.

For more details on the interpolation see the [crash handling documentation](tooling-micro-manager-running.html/#what-happens-when-a-micro-simulation-crashes).

## Next step

After creating a configuration file you are ready to [run the Micro Manager](tooling-micro-manager-running.html).
