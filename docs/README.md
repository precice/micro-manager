## What is this?

The Micro Manager is a tool to facilitate solving two-scale (macro-micro) coupled problems using the coupling library [preCICE](https://www.precice.org/).

## What can it do?

The Micro Manager is able to couple many micro simulations with one macro simulation. This includes:

- Passing data between micro and macro simulations
- Running micro simulations in parallel using MPI
- Adaptively turning micro simulations on and off based on similar micro simulations globally and locally
