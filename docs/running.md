summary: Run the Micro Manager from the terminal with a configuration file as input argument or from a Python script.
---

The Micro Manager is run directly from the terminal by providing the path to the configuration file as an input argument in the following way

```bash
micro-manager-precice micro-manager-config.json
```

The Micro Manager can also be run in parallel

```bash
mpiexec -n micro-manager-precice micro-manager-config.json
```

## What Happens When a Micro Simulation Crashes?

If a micro simulation crashes and the Micro Manager is configured to [interpolate a crashed micro simulation](tooling-micro-manager-configuration.html/#Interpolate-a-crashed-micro-simulation), the Micro Manager attempts to continue running. The error message from the micro simulation, along with the macro location are logged in the Micro Manager log file. The Micro Manager continues the simulation run even if a micro simulation crashes. Results of the crashed micro simulation are generated by interpolating results of a certain number of similar running simulations. The [inverse distance weighed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_distance_weighting) method is used. If more than 20% of global micro simulations crash or if locally no neighbors are available for interpolation, the Micro Manager terminates.
