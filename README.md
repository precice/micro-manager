A tool to facilitate solving two-scale (macro-micro) coupled problems using the coupling library [preCICE](https://www.precice.org/).

The main documentation is rendered on the [preCICE website](https://precice.org/tooling-micro-manager-overview.html).

Please report any [issues](https://github.com/precice/micro-manager/issues) and give us feedback through [one of our community channels](https://precice.org/community-channels.html).

The concept and initial design of the Micro Manager has been discussed in *Desai, Ishaan, & Bringedal, Carina & Uekermann, Benjamin. A flexible software approach to simulate two-scale coupled problems. ECCOMAS Congress 2022. [10.23967/eccomas.2022.037](https://doi.org/10.23967/eccomas.2022.037)*.
