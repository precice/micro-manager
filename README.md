# Micro Manager

A tool to facilitate solving two-scale (macro-micro) coupled problems using the coupling library [preCICE](https://www.precice.org/).

## Start Here

The main documentation is on the [preCICE website](https://precice.org/tooling-micro-manager-overview.html).

Please report any bugs and issues [here](https://github.com/precice/micro-manager/issues) and give us feedback through [one of our community channels](https://precice.org/community-channels.html).

The concept and initial design of the Micro Manager has been discussed in

The Micro Manager can adaptively control micro simulations. The adaptivity strategy is taken from two publications
