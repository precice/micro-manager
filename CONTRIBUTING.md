# Contributing to the Micro Manager

Contributions to the Micro Manager are most welcome! Please have a look at the page [contributing to preCICE](https://precice.org/community-contribute-to-precice.html) and also this page for more details.

## Automatic checks

We check every contribution with a few GitHub Actions workflows that report at the bottom of each pull request. For example, we have an Action to check if the contributed code is formatting correctly according to [autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/).

## Changelog

We maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` where all major changes and contributions are entered.
